**Gameplay:**
A game where you as the main character manipulates gravity to solve puzzles. We aim to create 10 levels, gradually introducing new mechanics for the game like spikes, portals, buttons, jumpads etc
Project Scope
We aim to have a small enough game that can be finished and refined in a month’s time, 
We chose to go for quality over quantity, the amount of levels are going to be less but the quality of the levels are going to be the main focus
Mechanics
We aim to create basic controls that can be used to the fullest so the game can be simple to operate but complex in mechanics. Only 6 keys will be used for this project.

The physics of the game operates like the real world would but you can bend the gravity of your own character, if possible we might also introduce physics props into the game as a means of creating more complex puzzles.

**Level progression:**
Level 1 - Will be used as tutorial level
Level 2,4,6,8 - Introduce mechanic 
Level 3,5,7 - Puzzle with previously introduce mechanics
Level 9 & 10 - Will not introduce new mechanics but stronger focus on the puzzle element

This pasting is done to introduce players to the basic mechanics before the last levels. The last levels will not introduce new mechanics so the player can fully focus on solving the puzzle

**Sounds:**
For Sounds & Sound effects for the game will be composed using open source programs like JSFXR etc.

**Assets:**
For Assets, mostly we will try to draw our own, but will source inspiration from the internet.

**Lore:**
In the distant future in the year 2063 FUCC (Fried Unlimted Chicken Corporation) replaced there steroids to output even more meat from chickens ! 

When they do so they discovered that the steroids that we're given to the chickens we're a tad bit too strong & thus displayed some interesting results causing some chikens to gain unnautral super powers ,like bending the laws of physics for there own sake. 

They we're taken to a lab established by FUCC in texas to be researched The FUCC wanted to enter other markets for quite a while now & has started a child company focues on researching the altering effects of the steroid. 

The SHAT (Scientifical Honor of Alterating Techonologies). 

And that previous gravity altering chicken that was mentioned... you play as him ! This was done to test the limits of what a special steroided chicken can achieve.
